# Which Button Should I Click in Shopify?

## ⚠️ You're Seeing "Build Legacy Custom Apps" Page

If you see a page with:
- **"Build legacy custom apps"** heading
- Warning: "Starting January 1, 2026, you will not be able to create new legacy custom apps"
- Recommendation: "For more app capabilities and next-gen development tools, use Dev Dashboard instead"

## ✅ What to Do

### Option 1: Use Dev Dashboard (Recommended)

**Don't click "Allow legacy custom app development"** - that's the old way.

Instead:

1. **Go to Shopify Partners** (free account)
   - Visit: `https://partners.shopify.com`
   - Sign up if needed (it's free)

2. **Create App There**
   - Click **Apps** → **Create app**
   - Choose **Custom app**
   - Configure Storefront API scopes
   - Get your access token

### Option 2: Temporary Workaround

If you need to proceed immediately:

1. **Click "Allow legacy custom app development"** (to enable the feature)
2. **Then navigate away** and use Shopify Partners dashboard instead
3. **Don't create apps using legacy method** - use Dev Dashboard

## 🎯 The Right Path

**Use Shopify Partners Dashboard:**
- Modern approach
- Better long-term support
- More features
- Not deprecated

**Avoid Legacy Custom Apps:**
- Being phased out
- Limited features
- Will stop working in 2026

## Quick Steps

1. **Go to:** `https://partners.shopify.com`
2. **Sign up** (if needed - free)
3. **Click:** Apps → Create app
4. **Follow:** Storefront API setup guide
