            <h2>My Professional Journey</h2>
            <p>From a chance encounter on Darley Street to becoming a qualified optometrist, my path has been driven by passion, dedication, and a commitment to exceptional patient care.</p>
            
            <div class="journey-timeline">
                <div class="timeline-item">
                    <div class="timeline-year">2014</div>
                    <div class="timeline-content">
                        <h4>Taking a Chance</h4>
                        <p>My journey in eye care began in February 2014, when I'd just moved from London to Bradford with my wife and our six-month-old baby. I was looking for more than just a job to pay the bills—I wanted something that offered growth and fulfillment. One day, while walking down Darley Street in Bradford, I saw a window advertisement for optical assistants.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="timeline-item">
                    <div class="timeline-year">2015</div>
                    <div class="timeline-content">
                        <h4>Academic Pursuits</h4>
                        <p>I got the job and I loved every minute of the work and was always excited about learning something and so within the first 3 months I been given a permanent position. This enthusiasm led me to approach my supervisors about enrolling in the day release Dispensing Optician (DO) course. In 2015, I started the DO course at Bradford College, graduating in 2018 with distinction—all while working full-time.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="timeline-content">
                        <h4>A Defining Moment</h4>
                        <p>Towards the end of the course, there was a pivotal moment that changed everything for me. One day at work, a patient I had previously helped was upset in the waiting area. She had been diagnosed with a retinal detachment and needed to go to A&E immediately. Despite her distress, she couldn't stop praising the optometrist for her calm and informative approach. That moment made me want to provide my patients with the same assurance and play a significant role in their lives.</p>

                        <h4>Looking Ahead</h4>
                        <p>I started my optometry course at Bradford University in 2021, graduated with First Class honours in August 2022, and completed my Pre-Registration period in February 2024. This experience inspired me to establish I Care Services, where I can play a pivotal role in the lives of my patients and community. I'm motivated to keep growing and learning, helping my community and inspiring future eye care professionals.</p>
